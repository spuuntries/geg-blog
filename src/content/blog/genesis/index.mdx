# you read that right.

I have a blog now!!! :)))

If you don't know who I am, great! :kms: UHmm, but if you do, I'll uh, jus, briefly go over who I am rq for the ones in the back >.>

# whoo u is?

I'm **spuun**, or **kek**, or any derivatives thereof.

I like to describe myself as a ~~barely-sane-not-tistic-mf~~ "tech enthusiast", but if you need some descriptor for what I do, I've done, and am currently actively also doing, some:  
 a. Digital and Traditional 2D Art;  
 b. Back-end Development;  
 c. AI Engineering;  
 d. Cybersecurity;  
 e. and Software Engineering.

In short, other than art, I like anything tech-related, basically. Anything you can mention about tech, I've probably read, or even dabbled in, at some point.

I'm currently a student at Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology (ITS), pursuing an AI Engineering major (2023 batch, AKA. da first batch~).

# y make blog

~TL;DR, dis dum mf haz 1 2 many tots n haz faced dis problem of forgetting dem <u>1 2 many damn time</u>~

> Thoughts. Fleeting thoughts. Moments in time you wanna capture and rewatch later. ☁

It's hard to describe how my brain works. I feel like just by looking at what I've put into that list up there, kinda puts into perspective how many things go thru my head at any given moment.

If you know me IRL, you'd know that I either don't talk as much, or space out every once in a good while bit when we interact. This is _not_ because I got bored and didn't pay attention to you or anything, but it's just that my brain often momentarily hyperfocuses on certain things and go deep into weird rabbitholes, and it all just, happens in that noggin, sometimes in somewhat inconvenient situations, but it happens I guess lol. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Idk if it's ADHD, or autism, or OCD, or GAD, or some other alphabetic contraction, but what I do know is that I have many thoughts that happen in way too short of a timeframe for it to ferment long enough to get stored in my memory.

So, to reiterate, problem? <u>I don't retain these trains of thoughts for nearly long enough to then bring them back up later on down the line when it'd be more useful for me.</u> I've had many moments where I had this idea, or this rabbithole, having gone into it deep, gotten somewhere, and I want to like, note it down for a bit, and maybe get back to it later on, maybe at a later date, but by the time I try to get back to it, much of it's already been lost to time. :C

**Soooo, solution:** Make a blog (?!) Yeyeye, make a blog.

This way, when I have an idea, or some weird thing I wanna pour and note down for a bit, I can just, write it down, then commit, then boom! It's on the net. Now, idk if it's a wise thing to pour your inner thoughts into something that otherwise could end up immortalizing itself, but fwiw I think it sounds like a worthy tradeoff for the moment being.

We'll see, we'll see. ^^

# so, wat do nao

Well, for one, let's talk abt the stuff I'm planning to put in here. I plan to put in:

1. **Blog Posts**: This is, well, uh, kinda a given, lol. But like, this is as in, tutorials, or some other things, yknow, kinda more "professional" stuff
2. **CTF Writeups**: I occasionally play CTF with [Heroes Cyber Security (HCS)](https://hcs-team.com/), the official academic CTF team from ITS, and I've always kinda wanted a spot to write my writeups in, but using smth like medium or gitbook or some other thing has always kinda rubbed me the wrong way, and when it's not a collective writeup it'd be kinda weird to shove that in the team's blog lol, so I'll prolly put my writeups here :)
3. **AI Reports**: I plan to do some experiments in the future and use this as a way to log my results. I've had moments where I did some very interesting experimentations on colab, but didn't really have a spot to write my findings, I think this'll come in handy for me too, so
4. **"IDEAS! Many Ideas!"**: Just, stuff, ideas, handwavy stuff, maybe we'll go over them in future experiments and put the report here as well ykno.
5. **Personal Stuff**: Well, um, as, again, this _is_ a blog, I can kinda use it for personal stuff too ig, so I might write some personal stuff as well, like philosophy, or politics, or just, in general some commentary, maybe on my personal pov as well too, who knows, venting, maybe (???)

In summary, this blog will be a sort of personal avenue I'll be using to put my thoughts into something more "tangible", so I don't forget or lose them in the future.

So yeah! Um, thanks for reading thru this first post, hope to see you on the next one :)
